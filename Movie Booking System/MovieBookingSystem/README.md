# Movie Booking System
We want to create a simulation of the movie booking system for specific theatre. This system
will be operated by the operator himself, he will be making booking against customer. The
objective of the system is to manage the booking for multiple screens, adding shows for the
screen and designing the seating arrangements as per the categories (premium, silver and
gold).
As per the movie booking request by the customer, operator should be able to check the
availability of the seat in category choice of user. Operator should be able to get the seat
availability and reports like, Collection report & shows report.
